# Supervising My Musical Taste
 
Music plays a great role in peoples life and influences different parts of the daily routine such as the mood or the performance in sports, study, work, etc. Therefore, in the contemporary era of information many researchers have dedicated their work to improving music recommendation systems that enable people to find new music or allow artists to reach a wider public.\\

This work emerges from the hypothesis that not all humans are sensitive to the same features and that the first question should be instead, what makes us like or dislike music?\\

Therefore, I decided to study the feature spaces generated by the songs I like the most and the ones I hate the most looking forward to detect which aspect of music is the one I am more sensitive to. Is it the timbre? the rhythm? a combination of both?. Although I am sure the context might influence a lot the emotions perceived in a musical piece, there is a pattern why friends and family tend to give accurate recommendations that lacks of any biases based on the context. This means they are capable of learning your musical taste, but are probably not able to describe it.\\

The aim of this work is precisely trying to detect the patterns that represent my musical taste in a supervised manner. Taking an accurate sampling strategy, using the appropriate learning considerations I want to separate songs into two distinct classes, songs I like and songs I would dislike.
